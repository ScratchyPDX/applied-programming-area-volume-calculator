# Overview

This TypeScript project serves as a learning tool for understanding language usage and syntax. It focuses on calculating properties of various shapes, including area, volume, and surface area. These shapes encompass circles, spheres, rectangles (squares), cones, and cylinders. Initially, I developed these calculations in a spreadsheet for another class, and I’ve now implemented them in code to validate their accuracy.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

The project was written using Visual Studio Code v1.91, Typescript v5.5.2, Node v22.0 and Jest 29.7. This project also utilizes Jest to perform unit testing of the calculations involved in the project. It also used Google TypeScript Style (gts) v5.3.1 for code styling and linter.

It is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript." -- Tutorials Teacher

# Future Work

- Add a GUI frontend to handle input and display.
- Make the calculation code a service queryable through an API.
- Much of the console interaction code is similar between each shape. While I used lists to recursively display some menu options, finding a way to make the rest of the display more dynamic, eliminating repetitive code, would be better. 
- Additionally, including more unit test code coverage would enhance overall completeness.
- Given the current limitations in calculations, expanding them to include more shapes and formulas would be beneficial.
